## Overview ##

AWS VPC Flow Logs are a data source by which a team can detect anomalies in connection patterns, use of non-standard ports,
or even view the interconnections of systems. To assist in the consumption and analysis of these logs, vpcflow-digesterd
provides APIs for generating vpc flow log digests and for retrieving those digests.

A digests is defined by a window of time specified in the `start` and `stop` REST API query parameters. See [api.yaml](â€¨https://github.com/asecurityteam/vpcflow-digesterd/src/master/api.yaml) for more information.

This project has two major components: an API to create and fetch digests, and a worker which performs the actual log compaction.
This allows for multiple setups depending on your use case. For example, for the simplest setup, this project can run as a standalone
service if `STREAM_APPLIANCE_ENDPOINT` is set to `<RUNTIME_HTTPSERVER_ADDRESS>`. Another, more asynchronous setup would involve running vpcflow-digesterd
as two services, with the API component producing to some event bus, and configuring the event bus to POST into the worker component.

<a id="markdown-modules" name="modules"></a>
## Modules ##

The service struct in the digesterd package contains the modules used by this application. If none of these modules are configured,
the built-in modules will be used.

```
func main() {
	...

	// Service created with default modules
	service := &digesterd.Service{
            Middleware: middleware,
    }
	...
}
```

<a id="markdown-storage" name="storage"></a>
### Storage ###

This module is responsible for storing and retrieving the vpc log digests. The built-in storage module uses S3 as the store and
can be configured with the `DIGEST_STORAGE_BUCKET` and `DIGEST_STORAGE_BUCKET_REGION` environment variables. To use a custom storage
module, implement the `types.Storage` interface and set the Storage attribute on the `digesterd.Service` struct in your `main.go`.

<a id="markdown-marker" name="marker"></a>
### Marker ###

As previously described, the project components can be configured to run asynchronously. The Marker module is used to mark when a
digest is in progess of being created and when a digest is complete. The built-in Marker uses S3 as its backend and can be configured
with the `DIGEST_PROGRESS_BUCKET` and `DIGEST_PROGRESS_BUCKET_REGION` environment variables. To use a custom marker module, implement
the `types.Marker` interface and set the Marker attribute on the `digesterd.Service` struct in your `main.go`.

<a id="markdown-queuer" name="queuer"></a>
### Queuer ###

This module is responsible for queuing digester jobs which will eventually be consumed by the Produce handler. The built-in Queuer POSTs
to an HTTP endpoint. It can be configured with the `STREAM_APPLIANCE_ENDPOINT` environment variable. This
project can be configured to run asynchronously if the queuer POSTs to some event bus and returns immdetiately, so long as a 200 response
from that event bus indicates that the digest job will eventually be POSTed to the worker component of the project. To use a custom queuer
module, implement the `types.Queuer` interface and set the Queuer attribute on the `digesterd.Service` struct in your `main.go`.

<a id="markdown-httpclient" name="httpclient"></a>
### HTTPClient ###

This is the client to be used with the default Queuer module. If no client is provided, a default will be used. This project makes use of
the [transport](https://github.com/asecurityteam/transport) library which provides a thin layer of configuration on top of the `http.Client`
from the standard lib. While the HTTP client that is built-in to this project will be sufficient for most uses cases, a custom one can be
provided by setting the HTTPClient attribute on the `digesterd.Service` struct in your `main.go`.

<a id="markdown-logging" name="logging"></a>
### Logging ###

This project uses [runhttp's Logger](https://github.com/asecurityteam/runhttp/blob/master/domain.go#L13) as its logging interface. Structured logs that this project emits
can be found in the `logs` package. The runhttp runtime injects loggers via HTTP middleware on the request context.

<a id="markdown-stats" name="stats"></a>
### Stats ###

This project uses [runhttp's Stat](https://github.com/asecurityteam/runhttp/blob/master/domain.go#L25) as the stats client. It supports a decent range of backends. The default stats
backend for the project is statsd using the datadog tagging extensions. The default backend will send stats to "localhost:8125". To change
the destination, modify the `RUNTIME_STATS_OUTPUT` environment variable.

<a id="markdown-exitsignals" name="exitsignals"></a>
### ExitSignals ###

Exit signals in this project are used to signal the service to perform a graceful shutdown. The built-in exit signal listens for SIGTERM and SIGINT and signals to the main routine to shutdown the service.

<a id="markdown-setup" name="setup"></a>
## Setup ##

* configure AWS to [publish flow logs to S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs-s3.html)
* create a bucket in AWS to store the created digests
* create a bucket in AWS to store progress states for queued digests
* setup environment variables
