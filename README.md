# vpcflow-digesterd #

**A service which creates, stores, and fetches digests for VPC flow logs**

## Overview ##

AWS Flow Logs are a data source by which a team can detect anomalies in connection patterns, use of non-standard ports, or even view the interconnections of systems.
To assist in the consumption and analysis of these logs, vpcflow-digesterd provides APIs for generating digests and for retrieving those digests.

A digests is defined by a window of time specified in the `start` and `stop` REST API query parameters. See [api.yaml](â€¨https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/vpcflow-digesterd/src/master/api.yaml) for more information.

## Setup ##

* configure AWS to [publish flow logs to S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs-s3.html)
* create a bucket in AWS to store the created digests
* create a bucket in AWS to store progress states for queued digests
* setup environment variables
